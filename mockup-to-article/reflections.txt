You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* What new skills have you learned?

  Before starting this class, I already had some familiarity using HTML, and so most of the course felt like a refresh of my skills, although I do feel like I learned a few new tips. The <figure> and <figcaption> tags were new to me, and reading through the Mozilla Developer Network tipped me off to some interesting additions and changes to the language -- for instance, <strikethrough> is depreciated, <strike> and <s> can be used for text decoration, but <del> is better for document edits. I also really enjoyed and appreciated the package tips given in the "How to Code Faster" segment of the sample of the Front End Web Development program.

  * What has been easy?

  HTML is fun for me. It's a system that's easy to pick up and play around with. The more you enjoy something, the easier it is.

  * What has been difficult?

  The most difficult thing about any coding, is knowing exactly how to find help. In this particular project, I had forgotten the <hr> tag, and it took me some time to find the exact wording of what I needed to search for in the documentation -- "horizontal rule" -- before I could find the answer I needed. But just knowing how the documentation is structured, I could go down a list of HTML elements until I saw <hr> and thought, "Aha. That's what I was looking for."

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  As I mentioned in the story above about looking up the horizontal rule element, <hr>, knowing how to browse and read the documentation is a crucial skill that can solve almost any problem!
